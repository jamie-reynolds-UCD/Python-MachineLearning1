# Python-MachineLearning1

The objective of this assignment was to implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in the scikit-learn framework. A notebook (MajorityClassClf) is provided with a simple example of a classifier that works with scikit-learn.

My implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier can be found in the "Assignment1_COMP47750.ipynb" file.

The full assignment can be seen in the "Ass1 Gaussian NB 2021.pdf" file.
